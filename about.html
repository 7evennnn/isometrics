  <h1>Built for the Constraints of Reality</h1>

        Most fitness advice assumes you have 90 minutes, a squat rack, and perfect health. 
        <strong>This site assumes you have none of those.</strong>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
        We provide science-based isometric protocols for high-stakes environments. Whether you are deployed in an austere location, recovering from a structural injury, or buried under a 100-hour work week, our goal is to help you <strong>hold the line</strong> on your physical capabilities.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Isometrics?</h2>
    <p>
        Research shows that maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) can effectively preserve muscle cross-sectional area and neurological force production. We focus on:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Zero Equipment:</strong> Utilizing self-resistance or structural environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Joint Longevity:</strong> Building strength at specific angles without the wear and tear of repetitive movement.</li>
        <li><strong>Time Efficiency:</strong> High-intensity stimulus in a fraction of the time of a traditional session.</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>The Honest Truth</h3>
        <p>
            If you have access to a fully equipped gym and the health to use it, <strong>go lift weights.</strong> Conventional resistance training is superior for maximum hypertrophy and athletic power. We aren't here to replace the barbell; we are here for when the barbell is no longer an option.

      <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <p>
          Q: What's an isometric?
            A: Contracting a muscle without movement (pushing/pulling against something that doesn’t move).
          Q: How can muscle grow if the weight isn’t moving?
            Muscle growth doesn't require movement, it requires mechanical tension and motor unit recruitment (MUR). 
            If you push with max effort, you get high degrees of MUR. Mechanical tension depends on force, not speed. 
          
            In fact, maximum force occurs at zero velocity (isometric). What matters is effort - pushing lightly against a wall does nothing; pushing as hard as possible does.
