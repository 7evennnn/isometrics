      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        This website was made to inform people about isometrics as a form of training for people with limited access to equipment.

        Isometrics can cause measurable muscle growth. The downside of doing them for a long period is that they can be uncomfortable, mentally taxing, and extremely boring.

        This website promotes isometrics as a maintenance or damage-control tool, a stopgap if you will.
        Isometrics can be surprisingly effective when traditional lifting alternatives are unavailable.

        For now, this website is for people who:
          - Cannot access weights
          - Want to maintain muscle with minimal recovery cost
      </p>

      <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <p>
          Q: What's an isometric?
            A: Contracting a muscle without movement (pushing/pulling against something that doesn’t move).
          Q: How can muscle grow if the weight isn’t moving?
            Muscle growth doesn't require movement, it requires mechanical tension and motor unit recruitment (MUR). If you push with max effort, you get high degrees of MUR. Mechanical tension depends on force, not speed. In fact, maximum force occurs at zero velocity (isometric). What matters is effort - pushing lightly against a wall does nothing; pushing as hard as possible does.
