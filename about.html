  <h1>Built for the Constraints of Reality</h1>
    
    <p class="lead">
        Most fitness advice assumes you have 90 minutes, a squat rack, and perfect health. 
        <strong>This site assumes you have none of those.</strong>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
        We provide science-based isometric protocols for high-stakes environments. Whether you are deployed in an austere location, recovering from a structural injury, or buried under a 100-hour work week, our goal is to help you <strong>hold the line</strong> on your physical capabilities.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Isometrics?</h2>
    <p>
        Research shows that maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) can effectively preserve muscle cross-sectional area and neurological force production. We focus on:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Zero Equipment:</strong> Utilizing self-resistance or structural environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Joint Longevity:</strong> Building strength at specific angles without the wear and tear of repetitive movement.</li>
        <li><strong>Time Efficiency:</strong> High-intensity stimulus in a fraction of the time of a traditional session.</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>The Honest Truth</h3>
        <p>
            If you have access to a fully equipped gym and the health to use it, <strong>go lift weights.</strong> Conventional resistance training is superior for maximum hypertrophy and athletic power. We aren't here to replace the barbell; we are here for when the barbell is no longer an option.
