  <p>
    Isometrics for muscle maintenance (and possible growth) in the absence of weight training

    In environments like Singapore National Service, where access to traditional resistance training is limited or nonexistent, isometric training can be used to maintain, and in some cases, build, muscle mass if applied correctly.

    The goal is not to replace weight training perfectly, but to provide a sufficient stimulus to your muscles under high systemic fatigue.
