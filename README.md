This website was made to inform people about isometrics as a form of training for people with limited access to equipment.


For now, this website is for people who:
- Cannot access weights
- Want to maintain muscle with minimal recovery cost


I might expand in the future to people who care about tendon health, and other use cases for isometrics.
