          Q: What's an isometric?
            A: Contracting a muscle without movement (pushing/pulling against something that doesn’t move).
          Q: How can muscle grow if the weight isn’t moving?
            Muscle growth doesn't require movement, it requires mechanical tension and motor unit recruitment (MUR). 
            If you push with max effort, you get high degrees of MUR. Mechanical tension depends on force, not speed. 
          
            In fact, maximum force occurs at zero velocity (isometric). What matters is effort - pushing lightly against a wall does nothing; pushing as hard as possible does.
